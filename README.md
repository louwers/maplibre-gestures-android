# MapLibre Gestures for Android

The MapLibre Gestures for Android library wraps [GestureDetectorCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/GestureDetectorCompat.html) and introduces implementation of scale, rotate, move, shove and tap gesture detectors.

MapLibre Gestures for Android was inspired by [Android Gesture Detector Framework](https://github.com/Almeros/android-gesture-detectors) and offers the same functionality with some additional features on top.

The library is implemented in the same app contained in this repository.
